        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One of my significant accomplishments as a coder is developing a Blood Bank Management System website during my second year in the web development course. The website facilitates the process of blood donation and allows individuals to acquire their required blood group free of cost by providing necessary information. I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, leveraging the XAMPP server for seamless integration. This project allowed me to apply my coding skills and knowledge to create a practical solution that can potentially save lives and contribute to the well-being of individuals in need.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Another notable accomplishment in my coding journey is achieving a high ranking in HackerRank, a renowned platform for coding challenges and competitions. I earned a certificate for solving 20 questions within a two-hour timeframe, demonstrating my proficiency and problem-solving abilities. This achievement highlights my dedication, skills, and commitment to continuously improving as a coder.

                Additionally, I have developed several mini projects that showcase my coding capabilities. These projects have been uploaded to my GitHub account, providing a portfolio of my work and allowing others to explore and learn from my code. By sharing my projects on GitHub, I aim to contribute to the coding community and inspire fellow developers.</li>
